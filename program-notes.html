                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Overview</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">Portrait in Seven Shades tells the story of seven painters — not through museum labels or historical commentary, but through sound. The suite connects two artistic worlds that share more similarities than we often realize. Musicians and painters both work with color, texture, contrast, and emotion. Both navigate doubt, discovery, and the search for honesty in their craft. And both reflect the world around them, helping us see — and hear — something new about ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">When Ted Nash was asked to create a long-form work for jazz orchestra, he built the piece around a simple but powerful idea: each movement would bring to life a different painter. He chose artists whose careers span roughly the same century in which jazz emerged and evolved — from impressionism to abstract expressionism. These painters transformed visual art just as jazz transformed American music. Nash embraced the idea that audiences already know these images, and could hear them reimagined through sound.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The result is a vivid seven-movement suite, each movement offering a musical interpretation of a painter's artistic voice, emotional world, and impact on culture. This performance brings that vision to life through the colors of the jazz orchestra, expanded with woodwind doubles, violin, and accordion.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Claude Monet's paintings dissolve reality into atmosphere — water, light, reflection, and gesture blending into one experience. The music captures this sense of drifting beauty. It begins with a simple rhythmic pattern, almost elemental, over which layers gradually form: low brass grounding the harmony, woodwinds floating in impressionistic colors. The themes are built mostly from major harmonies, giving the movement its brightness and gentle uplift. The solos wander playfully and curiously, mirroring the feeling of stepping close to a Monet canvas and seeing textures transform into pure color.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Dalí</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Salvador Dalí's world is familiar and bizarre at the same time — clocks melting, landscapes bending, images assembled in unsettling combinations. Nash reflects this surreal quality using sharp contrasts, unexpected harmonies, and an unusual meter derived from The Persistence of Memory. The movement is built over a steady ostinato that never quite settles, creating the feeling of time stretching or slipping. Layered melodies pull against the harmony, and improvisation becomes a kind of dream logic. Sharp accents and flamenco-like rhythms nod to Dalí's Spanish heritage, while the overall effect is one of instability and fascination.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Matisse</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Henri Matisse painted with bold joy — bright colors, simplified forms, and an almost childlike sense of play. Nash channels this spirit through rhythmic bounce and lively interaction between sections. The opening recalls the swirling energy of Matisse's La Danse. Angular lines in the lower winds meet whimsical replies from upper reeds and muted brass, like cut-paper shapes coming to life. The movement's middle section is warm and expressive, and the saxophones join for a jubilant soli passage. The whole piece radiates the same open-hearted delight that defines Matisse's late cutouts.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Picasso</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Pablo Picasso reinvented himself repeatedly, and Nash reflects that multiplicity through contrasting musical worlds. The opening explores the expressive, romantic side of Picasso — lyrical, direct, and deeply emotional. Suddenly the scene shifts, evoking the charged energy of Spanish bullfighting. The central cubist section breaks melody and harmony into geometric shapes: chords built in fourths, fragmented motifs, reflections and inversions, all circling a common tonal center. The movement grows more instinctive as it progresses, ultimately building toward a raw, powerful resolution.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Van Gogh</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Vincent van Gogh's story is inseparable from his art: longing, struggle, vivid emotion, and a search for belonging. Nash writes this movement almost like a song — simple, familiar, and heartfelt. The melody is wide and expressive, echoing the sweeping brushstrokes of The Starry Night and the deep emotion present in van Gogh's self-portraits. The lyrics (sung in some performances, spoken or instrumental in others) reflect scenes from van Gogh's life, turning the movement into a quiet conversation with the painter himself. It is the most intimate portion of the suite — a moment of compassion and understanding.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Chagall</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Marc Chagall's art is full of imagination: floating figures, musicians in the sky, village scenes layered with memory and folklore. Nash paints this world using sounds borrowed from Eastern European traditions. The movement opens with a brief cadenza that places the listener in a street scene between France and Russia. Violin and clarinet share the theme, evoking Chagall's love for the instrument, which appears frequently in his paintings. The music moves through vignettes — animals, celebrations, dancing — before rising into a spirited klezmer-style finale.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Pollock</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">Jackson Pollock's drip paintings break form into pure motion — splashes, gestures, and accidents combining into something intensely structured. Nash approaches this the same way: starting at the piano, he captured spontaneous clusters and rhythms, then built the movement around them. The opening is free and abstract, with the rhythm section exploring loose interpretations of the theme. The full band gradually assembles these fragments into a driving line, creating controlled chaos that reflects Pollock's process. The movement eventually settles into a blues, echoing the jazz Pollock himself loved and the era in which he worked.</p>
