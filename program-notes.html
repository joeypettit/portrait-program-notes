                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="card-text">Portrait in Seven Shades is a seven-movement suite by saxophonist and composer Ted Nash, each movement inspired by a different modern painter: Monet, Dalí, Matisse, Picasso, Van Gogh, Chagall, and Pollock. Rather than describing these artists in words, Nash translates their visual worlds into sound—capturing color, texture, and emotion through orchestration and improvisation.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The suite grew from a commission by Wynton Marsalis, Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, who encouraged Nash to create a long-form thematic work. Nash chose painters who lived within roughly a hundred-year span—parallel to the lifespan of jazz itself—allowing the music to explore artistic transformations across impressionism, surrealism, cubism, and abstract expressionism.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Nash draws strong parallels between painting and jazz. Both art forms wrestle with similar struggles—creation, doubt, discovery, and expression—and both rely on ideas of color, layering, and narrative. The chosen painters offer a wide range of emotional and stylistic possibilities, enabling each movement to feel distinct yet connected.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The music is written with specific soloists in mind, reflecting Nash's deep familiarity with members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. The original performance featured guest artists on violin, accordion, and tuba, expanding the palette of the jazz orchestra in ways that mirror the expressive breadth of the painters themselves.</p>
                    <p class="card-text mt-3"><strong>What follows is a brief guide to each movement:</strong></p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Monet</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80220" target="_blank">Claude Monet – Water Lilies (1914-26)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Inspired by Reflections of Clouds on the Water-Lily Pond, this movement evokes the diffused light and suspended atmosphere of Monet's late work. A primitive drum pattern opens the piece, followed by floating woodwind textures reminiscent of Debussy and Ravel. The movement expands like a sunrise, with luminous major harmonies, soaring soprano lines, and improvisations that explore playfulness, mystery, and fluidity.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title title-font">Dalí</h3>
                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79018" target="_blank">Salvador Dalí – The Persistence of Memory (1931)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Dalí's surrealist world—filled with familiar objects placed in unsettling contexts—inspires a movement built on distortion and dream logic. The Persistence of Memory shapes the unusual 13/8 time signature, while an aggressive groove underpins a disguised blues form. Sliding tonal centers, shadowed melodies, and fiery improvisation create a musical landscape as strange and gripping as Dalí's paintings.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78389" target="_blank">Henri Matisse – The Red Studio (1911)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Playful, bold, and childlike, Matisse's style is mirrored through rhythmic quirkiness and buoyant orchestration. Influenced by the spirit of La Danse and Matisse's later cut-outs, the movement features angular themes, humorous instrumental exchanges, and joyful ensemble writing. A lyrical baritone saxophone solo and lively sax soli capture the spontaneity and color at the heart of Matisse's art.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78311" target="_blank">Pablo Picasso – Girl Before a Mirror (1932)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">This movement reflects both the romantic warmth and the intellectual daring of Picasso, with special nods to Girl Before a Mirror and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. The music shifts from expressive lyricism into a musical "bullfight," then into a cubist soundscape built on intervallic fourths. Mirrored themes and layered tonalities create a musical analogue to Picasso's fractured, multifaceted images.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79802" target="_blank">Vincent van Gogh – The Starry Night (1889)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Full of emotional intensity, Van Gogh uses lyrics—Nash's first exploration of vocal writing—to tell the painter's story. Drawing from the tragedy, longing, and passion evident in Van Gogh's life and work, the movement unfolds like an American song form, offering a safe and tender space. The movement references The Starry Night and features expressive solo lines meant to echo Van Gogh's sweeping brushstrokes.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78984" target="_blank">Marc Chagall – I and the Village (1911)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Chagall's fantastical worlds—floating figures, musicians in midair, dreamlike village scenes—inform this movement's lively multicultural character. Accordion, violin, and tuba evoke the soundscape of Eastern Europe and Chagall's Jewish heritage. Whimsical melodies, dancing rhythms, and klezmer-inspired energy create a neighborhood celebration filled with nostalgia, color, and theatrical flair.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mb-2"><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78386" target="_blank">Jackson Pollock – One: Number 31 (1950)</a> | The Museum of Modern Art</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Abstract and explosive, Pollock reflects the painter's signature "drip" technique. Musical phrases are tossed like splatters onto a canvas—first freely, then shaped into long swinging lines. Improvised solos carry the spirit of abstract expressionism, while the shout chorus uses fixed rhythms with improvised pitches, creating controlled chaos. The movement ends in a cool minor blues that nods to the jazz of the 1950s, the era in which Pollock's work flourished.</p>
